## Welcome to EdenMind

We specialize in developing robust backend services, streamlined CI/CD pipelines, seamless deployment of machine learning models, and dynamic app development.

Our open-source repository lies at the heart of our technical operations, built on an array of modern technologies:

- **React Native**: Our applications are crafted with React Native, enabling efficient, cross-platform mobile development.

- **Kubernetes**: This orchestrates our containerized applications, ensuring scalability and reliable performance.

- **Grafana and Prometheus**: These tools provide us with detailed metrics and visual data analytics, facilitating effective system monitoring.

- **Terraform**: As our Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, it ensures efficient infrastructure management across platforms.

- **GitOps and Flux**: These enhance our workflow, with GitOps integrating Git at the heart of our delivery pipeline and Flux automating system updates to match configurations in Git.

Feel free to explore our open-source repository to see how EdenMind uses these technologies to deliver innovative solutions.
