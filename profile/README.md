## as-salāmu ʿalaykum 👋

Edenmind is a open-source foundation that is dedicated to developing software with a focus on Islam. Our mission is to create software solutions that are inspired by the teachings of the Quran and Sunnah. We believe that technology can be used to enhance and strengthen the bond between a Muslim and their faith. We strive to provide an easier way to access Islamic resources and tools that make it easier to practice and spread the teachings of Islam.

Some of the apps that we have developed:

- https://openarabic.io - Bilingual Islamic Texts
